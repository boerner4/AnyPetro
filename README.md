# AnyPetro
Software tool for the inversion of petrophysical laboratory data

## Installation
There are two ways for installing AnyPetro. If you are a MATLAB user, it is recommended to install a MATLAB APP within the MATLAB development environment. This is platform independent. Alternatively, you can install a stand-alone application on your Windows PC. The latter requires the installation of a MATLAB runtime environment, which means that the program takes up more memory. See the documentation for installation instructions. [[LINK TO DOCUMENTATION]](documentation/AnyPetro_documentation.pdf)
